Dear Player,
Though I try to express
how I think that, sometimes,  
life can be a bless,
I am still much too afraid
to speak with my own voice.
So I copy all the lonely souls
that once made me feel like I wasn't alone.

Men and women just like you and me,  
brave people  
who can be found seated alone in coffee shops,  
or lying in their beds,  
fearing even their own shadows,  
afraid of everything and everyone.

The kind of people who would have saved the world  
if only they could get out of bed.

Through their yellow caffeine teeth,  
they show us how beautiful life can be—  
how God has blessed us with coffee and cats,  
dog-shaped clouds,  
the inevitability of death,  
and pizza parties.

Now, all I hope, dear Player,  
is for you to see this work of mine  
not as a tribute to death,  
but as an ode to life itself—  
as a tribute to Alec Holowka,  
someone who created beautiful things  
and left us all too soon.

So, please, my loved Player—  
no more staying indoors.  
There’s a life to be lived,  
stray dogs to pet,  
and puddles to step.  
Fear not your own happiness,  
and remember:  
shared loneliness is not loneliness anymore.
